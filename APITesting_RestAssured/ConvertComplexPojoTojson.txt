Create separate been class for each sub class
	define its variables
	generate getters/setters
add those subclass into main pojo via object
 	create obj for each sub class
	define values for sub class variables through its corresponding getters & setters
user object mapper to serialise pojo to json

To elimate getters/setters code in program we opt for lombok
1)Add its maven dependency : https://projectlombok.org/setup/maven
2)Install Jar in eclipse :https://projectlombok.org/download
3)delete all getter&setter methods in pojo class add below annotations on top of class name
@Getter
@Setter
4)Run the program will run
5)Can also use @Data instead of @Getter
@Setter it will give additional methods like hashcode(), to string()
6)Instead of giving in class level can also give in variable level, it will create getter & setter for that particular variable alone
7)Can see getter & setter method in outline window can see explicitly inside class code
