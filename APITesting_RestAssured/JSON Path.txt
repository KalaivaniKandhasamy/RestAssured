While validating if we have to retrive a particulare key value pair and validate that we use json path to retrieve
2 ways/libraries for json path
	1)jayway (github)
	2)json slurper - rest assured based on groovy
Terms:
1.Notation - symolic representation = .,[]
2)Expresstion - query 
3)predicate - conditional operation result based on boolean for eg 1>10 - false
4)filters(operators) - filter based on logical operations 
5)Dictionary - inside {}
6)List - inside []

NOTATIONS AND OPETATORS (eg : jsonpath.com)
$ 			= indicate root ele
. or [''] [][""]	= indicate child
@ 			= current ele
* 			= wildcard/all element
.. 			= deep scan/recursive descent
[start:end]		= to slice array
[?(<expression>)]	= filter expresion , result should be boolean

FUNCTIONS 
$.min()
$.max()
$.length()
$.sum()
$.stddev()
$.avg()

ARRAY SLICING
1)[start:end] - start index is included, end index is excluded
	[1,2,3,4,5,6,5,7,8,9,10,11,12]
	path =[2:5]
 	o/p = [3,4,5]
2)if no index for start , then default to 0
	path =[:5]
 	o/p = [1,2,3,4,5]
3)if no index for end , then default to array length
	path =[5:]
 	o/p = [6,5,7,8,9,10,11,12]
4)negativ number iterate from end of the array
	path = [-1:]
	o/p = [12]
5)if start and end is same then result will be empty array
	path = [2:2]
	o/p = []
6)left to right reading , end index is negative it won't read
	path = [2:-2]
	o/p = []

if path = [-3:5] -> it will accept if start index is negative
	o/p = [10,11,12,1,2,3,4,5]

7)if start ele > array length then empty array returned
	path = [20:6]
	o/p = []
8) if end > array length , slicing will have till the end of the array
	path = [9:20]
	o/p = [9,10,11,12]
